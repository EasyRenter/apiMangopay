List of Mangopay API Call in PHP / Curl

Reason of this share: When i have develop my Mangopay custom payment module, it took me some time to figure how Mangopay API work. In fact, the Mangopay documentation is straightforward, in english (which isn't not my native langage) and there were not much examples on internet. Therefore i decide to share my code. I hope it will help others. And do not hesitate to propose improvements ;)

Futher informations: the original code have been made for a magento 1.9. So my code isn't fully adapted for classic php application and there may still be calls or functions specifics to the CMS.
